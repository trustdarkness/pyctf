  Phase class.  This is currently mostly a placeholder, but likely will

  A "Phase" is generically described as a series of functions that generate 
  flags around a learning objective.  Though there's no reason to group them 
  this way from a programming standpoint, it will assist in organizing a ctf
  around certain objectives.

  methods in phase classes are intended to run directly on exploitable hosts

  will be run as root on a metasploitable-based host.
